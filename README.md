# cloud-resume-challenge
ðŸš€ Cloud Resume Challenge built on Microsoft Azure. This project showcases my portfolio website featuring my resume, skills, certifications, and social links. It includes HTML/CSS, Azure Blob Storage (static website hosting), GitHub Actions for CI/CD, and future backend integrations like Azure Functions and Cosmos DB.

### âœ… Stage 4: Host Resume on Azure Static Website

I deployed my static HTML/CSS site to Azure Blob Storage using the static website hosting feature.

### âœ… Stage 5 and âœ… Stage 6: HTTPS for Azure Storage URL using Azure CDN | DNS Domain for Azure CDN endpoint

By default, the Azure Storage static website endpoint only supports HTTP, which is not secure.  
To enable HTTPS and serve the site on a custom domain, I integrated my storage account with Azure CDN.

### âœ… Stage 7 Frontend JS for Visitor Counter

I made my static website dynamic by fetching the visitor count from Azure Function and displaying it on my resume page.

To integrate my backend API with my resume site, I added a JavaScript fetch call inside index.html that requested the visitor count from my live Azure Function endpoint. I placed the result inside a <span> element to display the count dynamically. Initially, local testing showed "error" because of CORS restrictions, so I updated my Function Appâ€™s CORS settings in Azure to allow requests from my website domain. Finally, I uploaded the updated index.html to the $web container of my storage account. Once live, the site displayed the actual visitor count retrieved from Cosmos DB through the API.

### âœ… Stage 8 Azure Cosmos DB / Table Storage

My goal for this stage was to persist the visitor count using Azure Cosmos DB (with the Table API). This ensures the count is not lost when the Function App restarts.

Adding the Connection String

I copied the Primary Connection String from my Cosmos DB Keys blade.

### âœ… Stage 9 Azure Function Backend API (Visitor Counter)

The frontend connection to this API was already covered in Stage 7. This stage focuses only on backend setup, deployment, and configuration.

### âœ… Stage 11 - Python Code Testing

The goal of this stage was to ensure that the Azure Function backend logic for the visitor counter works correctly and handles requests as expected. This involved writing and running automated unit tests for the function using pytest.
