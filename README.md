# cloud-resume-challenge
ðŸš€ Cloud Resume Challenge built on Microsoft Azure. This project showcases my portfolio website featuring my resume, skills, certifications, and social links. It includes HTML/CSS, Azure Blob Storage (static website hosting), GitHub Actions for CI/CD, and future backend integrations like Azure Functions and Cosmos DB.

### âœ… Stage 5: HTTPS for Azure Storage URL using Azure CDN

By default, the Azure Storage static website endpoint only supports **HTTP**, which is not secure.  
To enable **HTTPS** and serve the site on a **custom domain**, I integrated my storage account with **Azure CDN**.

### Steps I Followed

1. **Purchased a Custom Domain**  
   - Bought the domain **preciousresume.site** from **Namecheap**.  
   - Updated the domainâ€™s nameservers to point to **Azure DNS** so I could manage DNS records directly in Azure.  

2. **Created a CDN Profile and Endpoint**  
   - In the Azure Portal, I created a **CDN Profile** under my resource group.  
   - Chose the **Standard Microsoft** tier.  
   - Added a **CDN Endpoint** and set the **origin type** to **Storage Static Website**, pointing it to my resumeâ€™s storage account.  

3. **Linked Custom Domain to CDN**  
   - Inside the CDN endpoint, I added my custom domain **www.preciousresume.site**.  
   - Created a **CNAME record** in Azure DNS to map `www.preciousresume.site` â†’ CDN endpoint hostname.  
   - Verified domain ownership successfully.  

4. **Enabled HTTPS**  
   - In the CDN custom domain settings, I turned on **Custom Domain HTTPS**.  
   - Selected the free **Azure-managed certificate** option.  
   - Waited for the certificate to be issued (â‰ˆ30 minutes).  

5. **Tested the Secure Website**  
   - Accessed my website at **https://www.preciousresume.site**.  
   - Verified the site loads securely with the padlock icon in the browser.  

### Key Benefits
- **Security** â€“ Enforced HTTPS with an Azure-managed SSL certificate.  
- **Professionalism** â€“ The site is hosted on a personal custom domain instead of the default Azure URL.  
- **Performance** â€“ Azure CDN improves speed and availability through global caching.
